# Contribution Guide for this System Design Repository
Thank you for your interest in contributing to System Design Repository, contributions are welcome and will be fully credited. This guide helps make contributing to System Design Repository simple and efficient for everyone.

## Idea

I created this repository because I thought it'll be a good idea to keep a repository of helpful resources from books to blog posts and interview questions. There isn't really a curriculum for preparing for systems design interviews or leveling up your skills asides working on applications/products that challenge you, and this repository was created to help with that.

## Guidelines

1. Feel free to contribute - make your changes and submit a PR.
2. If adding a new topic, please follow an alphabetical order. It helps other people locate the resources with ease.
3. Individual resources do not have to be in alphabetical order.
4. When creating a new topic, please make sure to add it to the Table of Contents
